                    <p>It was a no-brainer, at least in September. 
                        <br>
                        How could Howie not win the H. Marion Muckley Junior Businessperson of the Year Contest?  
                        Didn't his lawn care business, A Boy for All Seasons, have $ucce$$ written all over it?  
                        Why not chronicle his $ucce$$ September through June, then sell his journal as a how-to book for junior businesspeople! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How-to books offer advice, shortcuts and inspiration.

                        "The Confe$$ion$ and $ecret$ of Howard J. Fingerhut" offers that and so much more: 
                        Humor, heart and a resilient spirit.

                        Lowell visions a May Birthday Party with wall-to-wall kin: 
                        Crumm Creek loggers from his Mama's side, Piggott's Peak barrel-makers from his Papa's side, 
                        plus a passel of Granny Slocum's grape-growin', fiddlin' relatives from up on Slocum's Bluff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No matter that an Ozark rain storm is a-loomin' in the distance.  
                        Lowell knows jest as sure as snakes crawl that even iffen red skies 
                        an' low geese  an' leafbacks mean rain, and even iffen that rain begets floods, 
                        slides an' twisters, no hard-workin', family-lovin', smart an' clever folk would 
                        a-miss a kin's Birthday jest because of some pourdown.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No siree. They'd do what they had to.
