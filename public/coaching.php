                    a child doesn’t have the concentration of an adult. The child knows the television is in the next room.<br> 
                    It’s tough to hold a child, but it’s a lovely thing to try to do.” <br>

                    Working with writers wherever they are in the writing and publishing process, I help them
                    discover, craft and market their stories. Careful manuscript readings and thoughtfully-worded comments reflect my teaching and publishing
                    experience.

                <p class="summary">
                    Presentations occur in person, at a convenient Chicago location, or via a phone consultation. 
                    These one-on-one meetings offer invaluable insights to a writer's story spark, motivation 
                    and years on task in his writer’s journey. They also allow allow me the necessary information 
                    to best accommodate the writer’s story and the story he’s telling.

                    I aim specific criticisms of a specific manuscript towards universal tenets of writing for 
                    children in today's markets.

                    Rates reflect the hours necessary to thoughtfully read and 
                    consider your manuscript, then prepare and present a thoughtful, 
                    instructive analysis that enables you to move forward successfully.

                    I also now offer Office Hours, personal consultations in person or via the telephone,

                    I often work with Writer's Groups, too, facilitating sessions and/or teaching from the members' manuscripts.
