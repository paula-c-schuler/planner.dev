            <p>
            	I grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (I'm the bonneted, kneeling first grade girl,  
            	at Overbrook Elementary School's May Day celebration.) 
            </p>
            <p>
            	I'm known to tell writers, "Know what your character wants, what your character needs, 
            	what he or she wishes for, longs for, dreams of."
            </p>
            <p>
            	Can you guess my long-ago wish-dream-longing?
            	I wanted my name on the front cover of a children's book!
            </p>
            <p>
            	I still love the "happily-ever-after" endings of fairy tales, especially "The Ugly Duckling," 
            	and my orange "True Books" that offered up the childhoods of famous Americans.

            	The Penn Wynne Library was but a stone's throw away from my new suburban home in 1955. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	Thanks to my trusty library card, the first I'd ever owned, I spent my tenth year 
            	voraciously reading through the  blue-spine-ed books on the "K" shelves of the library's 
            	Children's Room. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	I rode along with Nancy Drew and her River Heights companions, seated 
            	in the back of Nancy's spiffy blue roadster, supposedly following clues and feeling the breeze, 
            	yet unknowingly uncovering how to tell a story.  
            </p>
            <p>
            	Through adolescence, I sewed along with Jo and her sisters, strolled the moors, walked the 
            	streets of Chicago with Sister Carrie.

            	I earned a degree in Elementary Education from the University of Pennsylvania, minoring in Journalism, 
            	and soon after began teaching fifth grade in Chicago.  
            </p>
            <p>
            	Eventually, I traded my Phillies hat for a Cubbie-blue cap, my cheese steak for a Chicago hot dog 
            	and teaching for Motherhood. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	When my son reconnected me with my long-ago wish-dream-longing, I was off and running on my 
            	Writer's Journey.  Fortunately, the Faith required of all Cubs fans served me well: 
            	my journey to publication took longer than expected!
            </p>
            <p>
  				Eventually, as I knew it would, my writer's plot line ended "happily-ever-after."
  				And lucky me! That Happy Ending spawned several New Beginnings.
