                <p>Lucky me! I spend my days doing what I love and loving what I do! I write 
                    picture books, board books, middle grade fiction. I teach adults writing for
                    children and coach writers of all ages to help them tell their stories. 
                </p>
                <a href="">More</a>

                <p> I grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  (I'm that bonneted, kneeling little girl,  
                	in the middle of the last century, in all my First Grade Glory, at Overbrook 
                	Elementary School's May Day celebration.) 
                </p>

                <p>	I'm known to tell writers: know what your character wants, what your character needs, 
                	what he or she wishes for, longs for, dreams of.

                	Can you guess my long-ago wish-dream-longing?
                	I wanted my name on the front cover of a children's book!

                	I still love the "happily-ever-after" endings of fairy tales, especially Hans Christian 
                	Andersen's THE UGLY DUCKLING, and my orange "True Books" that offered up the childhoods 
                	of famous Americans.
                </p>

                <p>The Penn Wynne Library was but a stone's throw away from my new suburban home in 1955. 
                	Thanks to my trusty library card, the first I'd ever owned, I spent my tenth year 
                	voraciously reading through the  blue-spine-ed books on the "K" shelves of the library's 
                	Children's Room. I rode along with Nancy Drew and her River Heights companions, seated 
                	in the back of Nancy's spiffy blue roadster, supposedly following clues and feeling the breeze, 
                	yet unknowingly uncovering how to tell a story.  Through adolescence, I sewed along with Jo 
                	and her sisters, I strode the moors, I walked the streets of Chicago with Sister Carrie. 
                	Writers are readers, and that's the Truth.  How nice that my Penn Wynne Library gifted me 
                	with so many wonderful teachers.

                </p>

                <p>I earned a degree in Elementary Education from the University of Pennsylvania, minoring in Journalism, 
                	and soon after began teaching fifth grade in Chicago.  Eventually, I traded my Phillies hat 
                	for a Cubbie-blue cap, my cheese steak for a Chicago hot dog and teaching for Motherhood.  
                	When my son reconnected me with my long-ago wish-dream-longing, I was off and running on my 
                	Writer's Journey.  Fortunately, the Faith required of all Cubs fans served me well: 
                	my journey to publication took longer than expected!

      				Eventually, as I knew it would, my writer's plot line ended "happily-ever-after."
      				And lucky me!
      				That Happy Ending spawned several New Beginnings.
