	                <h3>The Short Version</h3>
	                <br>
	                <p>I spend my days doing what I love and loving what I do! I write 
	                    picture books, board books, middle grade fiction and teach adults writing for
	                    children and coach writers of all ages to help them tell their stories. <br>
	                    I earned a degree in elementary education with a minor in journalism from the 
	                    University of Pennsylvania and soon therafter began teaching fifth grade in Chicago.
	                    Eventually, my son was born. He reminded me of how much I loved children's stories.
	                    I began my writing journey after he was born and have been walking that road ever since.

            	<h3>More of The Story</h3>

                <p> I grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  (I'm that bonneted, kneeling little girl,  
                	in the middle of the last century, in all my First Grade Glory, at Overbrook 
                	Elementary School's May Day celebration.) 
                </p>
                <p>	I'm known to tell writers, "Know what your character wants, what your character needs, 
                	what he or she wishes for, longs for, dreams of."
                	<br><br>
                	Can you guess my long-ago wish-dream-longing?
                	<br>
                	I wanted my name on the front cover of a children's book!
                	<br><br>
                	I still love the "happily-ever-after" endings of fairy tales, especially Hans Christian 
                	Andersen's "The Ugly Duckling," and my orange "True Books" that offered up the childhoods 
                	of famous Americans.
                </p>

                <p>The Penn Wynne Library was but a stone's throw away from my new suburban home in 1955. 
                	Thanks to my trusty library card, the first I'd ever owned, I spent my tenth year 
                	voraciously reading through the  blue-spine-ed books on the "K" shelves of the library's 
                	Children's Room. <br>
                	I rode along with Nancy Drew and her River Heights companions, seated 
                	in the back of Nancy's spiffy blue roadster, supposedly following clues and feeling the breeze, 
                	yet unknowingly uncovering how to tell a story.  <br>
                	Through adolescence, I sewed along with Jo and her sisters, strolled the moors, walked the 
                	streets of Chicago with Sister Carrie. Writers are readers, and that's the Truth.  
                	How nice that my Penn Wynne Library gifted me 
                	with so many wonderful teachers.

                <p>I earned a degree in Elementary Education from the University of Pennsylvania, minoring in Journalism, 
                	and soon after began teaching fifth grade in Chicago.  Eventually, I traded my Phillies hat 
                	for a Cubbie-blue cap, my cheese steak for a Chicago hot dog and teaching for Motherhood. <br> 
                	When my son reconnected me with my long-ago wish-dream-longing, I was off and running on my 
                	Writer's Journey.  Fortunately, the Faith required of all Cubs fans served me well: 
                	my journey to publication took longer than expected!<br><br>

      				Eventually, as I knew it would, my writer's plot line ended "happily-ever-after."
      				And lucky me! That Happy Ending spawned several New Beginnings.
