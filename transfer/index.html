                    <p>The Superlaser is the Death Star's main weapon.</p>
                    <p>The Superlaser is created by coordinating eight  
                        lasers manned by 168 gunners located in the Eye of the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Eye of the ship is a circular concave shape built around a focusing crystal.</p>
                    <p>The Eye has no defenses and requires military backup for protection.</p>
                    <div class="icons"><img src="/img/littlestdeathstar.png"></div>
                    <p>The Equatorial Trench is the large deep channel along the equator of the vessel.<br>
                        It contains many of the main systems including: <br>Landing bays, drive thrusters and tractor beams.</p>
                    <p>The surface of the Death Star is covered with thousands of buildings <br>so it looks like a massive city.</p>
                    <p>Mooring Towers dock large capital ships, from which the malicious malingering commander would sometimes control the fleet.</p>
